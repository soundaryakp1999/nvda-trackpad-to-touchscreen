# Touch Explore Sounds - trackpad-as-touchscreen mode.
#
# Reads the Windows Precision Touchpad's raw HID multi-touch contacts
# directly (independent of the OS mouse cursor and independent of whatever
# gestures Windows itself recognizes from the same physical trackpad), maps
# each contact proportionally onto the screen, and feeds them into NVDA's
# real touch pipeline (touchTracker.TrackerManager -> TouchInputGesture ->
# inputCore.manager.executeGesture) exactly as touchHandler.TouchHandler
# does for genuine touchscreen hardware. This makes every touch gesture -
# NVDA's own plus this add-on's split-tap - available from a trackpad on a
# machine with no touchscreen at all.
#
# Why raw HID rather than the mouse/cursor position: touchHandler's own
# touchSupported() requires GetSystemMetrics(SM_MAXIMUMTOUCHES) > 0, i.e. a
# real digitizer, so touchHandler.handler never exists on a trackpad-only
# machine - there is nothing to piggyback on. A trackpad exposed as a mouse
# only ever reports one cursor position at a time (multi-finger OS gestures
# are consumed by the trackpad driver before they reach an app as distinct
# points), so genuine multi-finger detection requires reading the
# touchpad's own HID digitizer collection (Usage Page 0x0D, Usage 0x05)
# directly via the Raw Input API, bypassing the OS cursor entirely.
#
# Confirmed by instrumented testing on real hardware (see CLAUDE.md):
#   - The touchpad enumerates as TWO separate raw input HID devices with
#     the same UsagePage/Usage/VendorId/ProductId: a real PnP device node
#     (openable via CreateFileW, used by the OS's own touchpad driver) and
#     a synthetic "\\?\Microsoft HID RID\..." device that raw input
#     messages actually arrive from. CreateFileW on the synthetic device's
#     own name fails (ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND); it must not be opened at all.
#   - The synthetic device has its OWN preparsed HID data, fetchable via
#     GetRawInputDeviceInfo(RIDI_PREPARSEDDATA) directly on its raw-input
#     handle - no CreateFileW/HidD_GetPreparsedData needed for it. Its
#     report layout (confirmed: report ID 1, 182-byte reports, 5 contact
#     link collections) does NOT match its PnP sibling's (report ID 129,
#     50-byte reports) - they are independent report descriptors and must
#     not be cross-matched; HidP_GetUsageValue against the wrong preparsed
#     data fails with HIDP_STATUS_INCOMPATIBLE_REPORT_ID.
#   - Tip Switch (0x0D, 0x42) and Confidence (0x0D, 0x47) are 1-bit BUTTON
#     usages, not values - they only show up via HidP_GetButtonCaps/
#     HidP_GetUsages, never via HidP_GetValueCaps. (An earlier version of
#     this add-on concluded from a value-caps-only dump that this hardware
#     had no Tip Switch at all; a button-caps probe later showed it does -
#     Tip, Confidence and In Range (0x32) on every contact link collection.)
#     Contact liveness is based on the device-level Contact Count usage
#     (0x0D, 0x54), refined by Tip/Confidence whenever the device exposes
#     them - see _DeviceParser.decode and TrackpadTouchScreen._applyFrame.
#   - Hybrid reporting mode (spec: a device with fewer contact slots per
#     report than contacts it tracks splits one frame across several
#     reports; only the first carries the real Contact Count, the rest
#     report 0, all share the same Scan Time) is reassembled by
#     _FrameAssembler. Not exercised by the development hardware (5 slots
#     per report, parallel mode), so kept strictly additive: a device that
#     always fits a frame in one report behaves exactly as before.
#   - A capability-only CreateFileW open of a HID device (dwDesiredAccess=0)
#     succeeds even while the OS's own touchpad driver holds the device for
#     read/write; requesting GENERIC_READ|GENERIC_WRITE fails with
#     ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION. Irrelevant now that RIDI_PREPARSEDDATA avoids
#     CreateFileW for the synthetic device entirely, but kept as a fallback
#     path in case a future/different touchpad doesn't support
#     RIDI_PREPARSEDDATA on its raw-input handle.
#   - Raw input device handles are NOT stable across process restart; a
#     fresh device search (by UsagePage/Usage, and for the PnP fallback
#     path also VendorId/ProductId) must be done each time this starts.
