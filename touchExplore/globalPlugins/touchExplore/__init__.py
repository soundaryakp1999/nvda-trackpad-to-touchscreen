# Touch Explore Sounds
# A global plugin for NVDA that improves touch-explore feedback:
# - Plays a short earcon when the finger lands on a real, actionable item
#   (icon, list item, button, link, etc - a different one per kind of
#   control, panned by position; see audioCues.py), and moves real focus/selection to
#   it (VoiceOver-style), letting NVDA's own focus-speech pipeline announce
#   it correctly (role suppression, selection state, etc) instead of us
#   re-implementing that logic and risking double speech.
# - Stays silent when the finger is over empty space inside a container
#   (e.g. the gap between desktop icons), instead of repeating the
#   container's "N items" description on every micro-movement.
# - Adds a VoiceOver-style split-tap gesture: hold one finger on a
#   touch-explored item, tap anywhere else on the screen with a second
#   finger, and that item is activated (its default action performed) -
#   equivalent to double-tapping the item itself, without needing to lift
#   and re-tap the same exact spot.
# - Adds a trackpad-as-touchscreen mode (NVDA+Ctrl+Shift+T to toggle): reads
#   the trackpad's own raw multi-touch HID contacts and feeds them into
#   NVDA's real touch pipeline, so every touch gesture above - and NVDA's
#   own stock touch gestures - work from a trackpad on a machine with no
#   touchscreen. See trackpadTouch.py for the implementation and
#   CLAUDE.md for the hardware-verified details behind it.
#
# Touch explore-by-touch reporting lives in
# screenExplorer.ScreenExplorer.moveTo(), called directly by touchHandler
# as the finger moves. There's no extension point for it, and touchHandler
# can recreate ScreenExplorer instances at any time (e.g. when touch
# support is toggled or a config profile switch occurs), so rather than
# patching one instance, we patch the moveTo method on the class itself.

# MSAA SELFLAG_TAKEFOCUS | SELFLAG_TAKESELECTION. NVDA's own

# but does *not* change selection, which is why calling it left every
# desktop icon reporting "not selected" regardless of which one was
# touched - focus moved, but the previously-selected icon (if any) stayed
# selected and the touched one never became selected. Passing both flags
# together is the standard "click this item, exclusively selecting it and
# deselecting everything else" operation for single-select MSAA controls.

	"""Move real focus and selection to obj, mirroring VoiceOver: touch-explore
	doesn't just narrate items, it makes the touched item the
	actually-focused/selected one (and, for single-select controls,
	unselects whatever was selected before). This is what makes
	"selected"/"not selected" state speech meaningful rather than noise -
	the touched item is expected to read as selected, so NVDA's own "don't
	announce selected for the sole selected item, but do announce unselected
	siblings" logic does the right thing without us fighting speech
	internals across multiple code paths (object speech, text info speech,
	etc).

	Classic MSAA/IAccessible controls (e.g. the desktop and Explorer's
	SysListView32) need an explicit accSelect() call with both
	SELFLAG_TAKEFOCUS and SELFLAG_TAKESELECTION - NVDA's own setFocus() on
	these objects only passes TAKEFOCUS. Modern UIA-backed controls handle
	focus and selection as separate concerns too - UIA's SetFocus() only
	moves focus - so there selection needs the SelectionItemPattern's
	select() explicitly, which NVDA's own doAction() uses the same way and
	which also moves focus as part of selecting.

	Returns True if it started a real focus change - which NVDA's focus
	event will then announce - or False if it did nothing (not focusable,
	already focused, or every attempt failed), in which case nothing will
	announce obj unless the caller does. (Silently returning without
	announcing was the cause of touch-explore saying nothing at all over
	non-focusable content, e.g. most of a web app - see CLAUDE.md.)

	Selection, as opposed to focus, is only taken for the roles
	_processNegativeStates reports "not selected" on (list/tree items, table
	rows/cells/headers) - the whole reason for selecting at all. Anything
	else only gets focus: "selecting" a radio button checks it and
	"selecting" a tab switches to it, which touching must never do.

	(NVDA+numpad6/4/8/2, etc) always has - it's stock NVDA behavior, not

	This makes flick-based object navigation match touch-explore's own

	into an app the user can't see. Skip the real focus/selection move (and

# --- Multi-finger tap misdetection fix --------------------------------
# NVDA sometimes recognizes a 3-finger (or 2-finger) tap as having fewer
# fingers than were actually used. Diagnosed via log.debug instrumentation
# on touchTracker.TrackerManager: SingleTouchTracker.update() only
# classifies a completed touch as action_tap if it stayed within
# touchTracker.maxAccidentalDrift (10px) of its start point for its entire
# duration; if it drifts further it's left as action_unknown and never
# reaches processAndQueueMultiTouchTracker's merge logic at all (only
# non-unknown actions get queued/merged there). With multiple simultaneous
# fingers, it's normal for at least one to drift more than a single
# practiced finger tap would - observed drift on failed 3-finger taps was
# up to ~19px, comfortably exceeding the 10px default and causing 1-2 of
# the 3 fingers to silently drop out, so NVDA reports a 1 or 2 finger tap
# instead. Raising the threshold fixes this at the source (touch tracking
# is otherwise unmodified) without touching the merge logic itself, which
# behaved correctly (pure time-interval overlap; not the actual culprit -
# multi-finger flicks, which don't have a drift ceiling, always merged
# correctly in the same test session).
# Now configurable, in millimetres per input source rather than a fixed
# 25px: see touchSettings.py ("Tap movement tolerance").
# --- end multi-finger tap fix -------------------------------------------


# --- Tap/flick classification timeout fix -------------------------------
# touchTracker.SingleTouchTracker.update() locks a touch's action to HOVER
# the instant touchTracker.multitouchTimeout (0.25s default) elapses since
# the touch started, on ANY update() call (not just on lift) - regardless of
# what the finger does afterward. Diagnosed via log.debug instrumentation on
# trackpadTouch.TrackpadTouchScreen while investigating multi-finger taps
# and flicks not registering in trackpad-as-touchscreen mode: a deliberate,
# genuine 2-finger tap attempt was observed taking longer than 250ms
# door-to-door (coordinating two fingers to touch and lift together takes
# real, measurable time), so by the time the fingers lifted, both had
# already been irreversibly locked to HOVER and could never become
# action_tap/action_flick* at all - not a merge-logic problem, and not
# fixable by any amount of prompt update() calling once the 250ms window has
# actually elapsed relative to real time. Raising the timeout gives real
# human multi-finger gestures (and flicks in general) more realistic budget
# to complete before being written off as a hover, at the cost of also
# giving a genuinely slow hover/drag slightly longer before NVDA starts
# treating its own continued movement as touch-exploring rather than a
# potential tap-in-progress - same class of "the machine-tight default
# doesn't match real human timing" fix as the drift patch above, and
# extended module-globally the same way, applying to real touchscreen
# gestures too, not just trackpad mode (accepted; see CLAUDE.md).
# Now configurable per input source (default still 0.4s): see
# touchSettings.py ("Gesture time").

# Diagnosed from a real log (VS Code's webview UI, Chromium): two whole

# moving real focus to the touched item and letting NVDA's focus event
# announce it, but most web content (text, headings, groups, images) isn't
# focusable, so nothing spoke - and where it did speak, the browse-mode path
# read a whole element's text ("too much text"), not what was under the
# finger. Web content therefore gets its own path, modelled on NVDA's own
# mouse tracking (NVDAObject.event_mouseMove), which handles web content
# well: the text under the finger, a line at a time, for text-like content;
# the element itself (name, role, states) for real elements; real focus never
# moved (web apps react to focus - menus open, NVDA switches to focus mode -
# and VoiceOver doesn't move it either; double-tap activation still works via
# the review position, set exactly as stock moveTo sets it).
